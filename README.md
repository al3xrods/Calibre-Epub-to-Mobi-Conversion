# Calibre-Epub-to-Mobi-Conversion

This Python script is intended to automate the process of converting epub files to mobi format using Calibre application. The script searches for epub files in the "Downloads" folder and moves them to "Calibre Books" folder. Then, it opens the Calibre application and waits for user input to initiate the conversion process.

Once the user inputs "Y", the script searches for mobi files in the "New Folder" subdirectory of "Downloads" folder, which are the converted books from epub. It then moves the mobi files back to the "Downloads" folder and terminates the Calibre application.

This script is useful for Kindle users who prefer to download books in epub format and convert them to mobi using Calibre for better compatibility with Kindle devices.
